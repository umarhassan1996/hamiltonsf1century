  <p> No driver in the 70-plus year history of Formula One has ever won 100 Grand Prix. It’s a record that would never see the light of day until now. </p> 

    <p> Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of breaking yet another record in his Formula One career by becoming the first driver to win a century of Grand Prix races.
In his 15th season in Formula One, Hamilton is tied with Germany’s Michael Schumacher for the most World Championships won by a driver with seven. </p>

  <p> After winning the 2021 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, he’s now one Grand Prix away from making more Formula One history with 99 wins to his name. </p>
  
  <p> How did the Briton end up on this journey to becoming Formula One’s Grand Prix-winning centurion?
