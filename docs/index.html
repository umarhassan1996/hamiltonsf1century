<p> No driver in the 70-plus year history of Formula One has ever won 100 Grand Prix. It’s a record that would never see the light of day until now. </p>
      
<p> Mercedes’ Sir Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of breaking yet another record in his Formula One career by becoming the first driver to win a century of Grand Prix races.</p>
    
<p> The 2021 British Grand Prix was his 99th win in F1. Hamilton is now one race away from making more history as the first driver in the championship to win 100 Grand Prix races.</p>
      
<p>How did the Briton end up on this journey to becoming Formula One’s Grand Prix-winning centurion?</p>

              <h2> A star is born - Hamilton’s first F1 win in Canada </h2>           
              
              <p>Having a two-time World Champion as your team-mate in your debut F1 season is a tall order for a new F1 driver on the grid, but Hamilton secured one third place and four two second-place finishes in his first five Grand Prix starts in his rookie season.</p> 
              
              <p>The turning point for Hamilton was in his sixth Grand Prix start in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on the 8-10 June 2007 for the Canadian Grand Prix.</p>
              
              <p>Hamilton achieved his first Pole Position in F1 with a 1:15.707 on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, out-qualifying his double World Champion Spanish team-mate Alonso in second place.</p> 
              
              <p>He then went one better on Sunday 10 June 2007 by winning his first-ever F1 Grand Prix in Canada by over four seconds from Germany’s Nick Heidfield, who at the time raced for BMW Sauber. </p>
