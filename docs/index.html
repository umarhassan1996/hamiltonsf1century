<p> No driver in the 70-plus year history of Formula One has ever won 100 Grand Prix. It’s a record that would never see the light of day until now. </p>
      
<p> Mercedes’ Sir Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of breaking yet another record in his Formula One career by becoming the first driver to win a century of Grand Prix races.</p>
    
<p> The 2021 British Grand Prix was his 99th win in F1. Hamilton is now one race away from making more history as the first driver in the championship to win 100 Grand Prix races.</p>
      
<p>How did the Briton end up on this journey to becoming Formula One’s Grand Prix-winning centurion?</p>

          <p>Following on from winning his first F1 World Championship in 2008, Lewis Hamilton had won 12 Grand Prix races between 2009 to 2012 for McLaren. </p>
                             
                              </div>

              <h2> A Star is Born </h2>           
              
 <p> Having a two-time World Champion as your team-mate in your debut F1 season is a tall order for a new F1 driver on the grid, but Hamilton secured one third place and four two second-place finishes in his first five Grand Prix starts in his rookie season. </p>
<p> The turning point for Hamilton was his sixth Grand Prix start in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on the 8-10 June 2007 for the Canadian Grand Prix. </p>
<p> Hamilton achieved his first Pole Position in F1 with a 1:15.707 on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, out-qualifying his double World Champion Spanish team-mate Alonso in second place.</p>
<p> He then went one better on Sunday 10 June 2007 by winning his first-ever F1 Grand Prix in Canada by over four seconds from Germany’s Nick Heidfield, who at the time raced for BMW Sauber. </p>
<p>Three more race wins followed after Montreal in the United States, Hungary and Japan, before finishing runner-up to Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen in Hamilton’s rookie 2007 F1 season. </p>
                              
                              <h2> Second season redemption </h2>
                              
<p> Following the heartache of losing the 2007 F1 World Championship by one point, the 2008 season was filled with more ups and downs for Hamilton.

 <p> At the season-opening 2008 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne got the then 23-year-old Briton off to a perfect start with a win. Hamilton also won his first Monaco Grand Prix in changeable conditions, but the standout win in his then-young F1 career was on home soil at Silverstone.</p>

                              <p> The 2008 British Grand Prix saw Hamilton qualify in fourth place for the Grand Prix. When it came to race day, the then 23-year-old McLaren driver put in a dominant performance in the rain to lap the entire grid and win in front of the British fans. </p>

                              <p> Following on from his British Grand Prix win, Hamilton recorded his fourth win of the season at the Hockenheimring in Germany to lead the Drivers’ Championship by four points from then Ferrari driver Felipe Massa. </p>

                              <p> 12 months after his McLaren was beached in the gravel on the entry to the pit-lane in China, the tables had turned the other way for Hamilton this time around in Shanghai. </p>
                              
 <p> Hamilton put in a dominant performance in qualifying and won the Chinese Grand Prix, ahead of the Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen, which led to the dramatic showdown in Interlagos.</p>

                           <p> For the second time in three years, Massa won the Brazilian Grand Prix for the second time in three years and was the 2008 F1 World Champion. </p>
                              
<p> 40 seconds later, Hamilton’s McLaren overtook the Toyota of Timo Glock on the last corner on the last lap at Interlagos to claim fifth place and become the youngest-ever F1 World Champion at the time at 23 years, 300 days.  </p>
