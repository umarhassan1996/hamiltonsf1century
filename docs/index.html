<p> No driver in the 70-plus year history of Formula One has ever won 100 Grand Prix races. It’s a record that would never see the light of day until now. </p>
      
<p> Mercedes’ Sir Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of breaking another record in his Formula One career following his 99th win at the 2021 British Grand Prix.</p>

      <p> Hamilton is one race away from making more history as he attempts to become the first driver in the championship to win 100 Grand Prix races. </p>

      <p> How did the Briton end up on this journey to possibly becoming the first Grand Prix-winning centurion in Formula One? </p>

          <p>Following on from winning his first F1 World Championship in 2008, Lewis Hamilton had won 12 Grand Prix races between 2009 to 2012 for McLaren. </p>

              <h2> A Star is Born </h2>           
              
<p> Following a series of excellent results in his first five races during the 2007 F1 season, the turning point for Hamilton came in Canada. </p>

        <p> The stage was set at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on the 8-10 June 2007 for the 2007 F1 Canadian Grand Prix. </p>

        <p> In his sixth Grand Prix, Hamilton popped his McLaren into Pole Position with a 1:15.707, out-qualifying his double World Champion Spanish team-mate Fernando Alonso, who qualified in second place. </p>
        
<p> Hamilton then went on to convert his Pole Position into his first F1 Grand Prix win by winning the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. Three more race wins followed after the Briton’s win in Montreal in the United States, Hungary and Japan. </p>

   <p> Before the last race of the 2007 F1 season, Hamilton was leading the Drivers’ Championship heading into the season finale at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The dream of winning a F1 World Championship in his debut season wasn’t to be for Hamilton as he finished runner-up to Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen, who became World Champion by winning at Interlagos. </p>
                              
                              <h2> Second season redemption </h2>
                              
<p> Following the heartache of losing the 2007 F1 World Championship by one point, the 2008 season was another rollercoaster year for Hamilton at McLaren. </p>

        <p> The 23-year-old Briton at the time got off to a perfect start with a win at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. </p>

        <p> Two months after winning at Albert Park, his second win of the 2008 F1 season came on the streets of Monte Carlo at the Monaco Grand Prix, but the standout win in his then-young F1 career was on home soil at Silverstone. </p>

        <p> The 2008 British Grand Prix saw Hamilton qualify in fourth place for the Grand Prix. When it came to race day, the McLaren driver put in a dominant performance in the rain to lap the entire grid and win in front of the British fans. </p>
        
<p> After winning his first British Grand Prix, Hamilton recorded his fourth win of the season in Germany to lead the Drivers’ Championship by four points from Ferrari’s Felipe Massa. </p>

        <p> 12 months after his McLaren was beached in the gravel on the entry to the pit-lane in China, the tables had turned the other way for Hamilton this time around in Shanghai.</p>

        <p> Hamilton put in a dominant performance in qualifying and won the Chinese Grand Prix, ahead of the Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen, leading to the dramatic showdown at Interlagos.</p>
        
<p> For the second time in three years, Massa won the Brazilian Grand Prix for the second time in three years and was the 2008 F1 World Champion. 
40 seconds later, Hamilton’s McLaren overtook the Toyota of Timo Glock on the last corner of the last lap at Interlagos to claim fifth place and become the youngest-ever F1 World Champion at the time at 23 years, 300 days. </p>

        <h2>Hamilton’s first win for Mercedes - 2013 Hungarian Grand Prix </h2>

        <p> Joining a new team is never easy for a F1 driver, but Hamilton had his work cut out against Rosberg. </p> 

        
        <p> The German had joined the team in 2010 after Mercedes-Benz bought out Brawn Grand Prix and had one win to his name with winning the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix. </p>

        <p> Rosberg had won two Grand Prix before Hungary at Monaco and Britain and Hungary is a track that the Briton has won on three times in his career at the time.</p>

        <p> Unsurprisingly, Hamilton won in hot conditions at the Hungaroring, qualifying in Pole Position and then took the chequered flag to take his first win for Mercedes. </p>

        <p> While Hamilton failed to win any Grand Prix outside of Hungary in 2013, the new era of F1 engines with hybrid power was coming around the corner for the 2014 season. </p>
