  <p> No driver in the 70-plus year history of Formula One has ever won 100 Grand Prix. It’s a record that would never see the light of day until now. </p> 

    <p> Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of breaking yet another record in his Formula One career by becoming the first driver to win a century of Grand Prix races.
In his 15th season in Formula One, Hamilton is tied with Germany’s Michael Schumacher for the most World Championships won by a driver with seven. </p>

  <p> After winning the 2021 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, he’s now one Grand Prix away from making more Formula One history with 99 wins to his name. </p>
  
  <p> How did the Briton end up on this journey to becoming Formula One’s Grand Prix-winning centurion?

              <h2> A star is born - Hamilton’s first F1 win in Canada </h2>           
              
              <p>Having a two-time World Champion as your team-mate in your debut F1 season is a tall order for a new F1 driver on the grid, but Hamilton secured one third place and four two second-place finishes in his first five Grand Prix starts in his rookie season.</p> 
              
              <p>The turning point for Hamilton was in his sixth Grand Prix start in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on the 8-10 June 2007 for the Canadian Grand Prix.</p>
              
              <p>Hamilton achieved his first Pole Position in F1 with a 1:15.707 on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, out-qualifying his double World Champion Spanish team-mate Alonso in second place.</p> 
              
              <p>He then went one better on Sunday 10 June 2007 by winning his first-ever F1 Grand Prix in Canada by over four seconds from Germany’s Nick Heidfield, who at the time raced for BMW Sauber. </p>
