          <p>Since the 2000’s, Matt Neal and Jason Plato have provided many memorable moments in the British Touring Car Championship. Umar Hassan visualises the rivalry between Neal and Plato. </p>
          </p>

<p>There have been many rivalries between drivers in the 60-plus year history of the British Touring Car Championship.  </p>

<p> The BTCC rivalry that always provided fireworks on and off-track in the championship was between <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnealracing">Matt Neal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonplato">Jason Plato.</a></p>

<p> Both drivers debuted in the Super Touring era of the British Touring Car Championship in the 1990’s.</p>

<p>Having raced both full-time and part-time in the BTCC since 1991, it took nine seasons for Neal to claim his first race win.</p>

<p>For the 1999 season, the Stourbridge driver raced for the team his father Steve co-founded, Team Dynamics in a 1998 Nissan Primera GT. </p>

<p>TOCA’s Alan Gow put a £250,000 cash prize for the first independent team who won a race in the BTCC for the 1999 season.</p>

<p>Neal took full advantage of this incentive in his 129th BTCC race start by winning Race 2 at the opening race weekend at Donington Park in 1999, claiming the £250,000 prize from Alan Gow.</p>

<p>Since making his debut in the BTCC in 1997, Jason Plato was slotted into one of the top teams at the time, the Williams Renault Dealer Racing Team. </p>

<p>Plato’s team-mate in his BTCC rookie season was Alain Menu, who went onto claim the 1997 British Touring Car Championship title that year.</p>

<p>While it took eight years for Neal to claim his first BTCC race win, Plato secured two wins at Snetterton and Silverstone, which led to him finishing in third place in his debut season.</p>

<p> While Neal and Plato have a combined five BTCC titles between them, Neal has one more BTCC title with three, compared with Plato’s two.</p>

<p>All three of Neal’s BTCC titles he’s won have been with Team Dynamics, with the first title coming 14 years after his debut in 2005 in the Honda Integra.</p>

<p>Two more BTCC titles followed for the Midlander in 2006 and 2011, who has the same number of titles as Gordon Shedden, Win Percy and Bill McGovern. </p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7077239"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Plato’s first BTCC title came in 2001 for Vauxhall Motorsport after a tense battle with his team-mate Yvan Muller. </p>

<p>Plato had to wait nine years after his first title to become the 2010 BTCC Champion for Silverline Chevrolet, joining James Thompson, Alain Menu and Jack Sears who have won two BTCC titles.</p>
